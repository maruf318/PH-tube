    <h1>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
    <p>
      When there is a missing value or if we dont initialize the type then
      usually we get Undefined. If we intensionally keep an empty value then we
      can say this to be null. Example of a null can be a object with const
      friend={name:"sakib", salary:null}. Here we used null to indicate that the
      object property of salary empty state and has no value. For the same
      example if we want to find the age of friend object then it will give us
      undefined. Its better to use null.

    <h1>What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
    <p>
      A REST API (Representation state Transfer API) is a programming interface
      that uses HTTP requests to access data using PUT, GET , POST and DELETE
      method. Basically My web page communicates with a cloud-based server via a
      rest API. They are all about communication means from client side to
      server or vice versa. The Equivalent of Create in an HTTP method is Post,
      Read is Get, Update is Put and Delete is Delete.
