        Q1: Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
      </h1>
      <p>
        ->Var is a old way to declare variables in javascript whereas let and
        const were introduced in ES6. let is only accessible within a block
        where they were declared. var has a hoisting behavior which means we can
        access var throughout the scope. and using var can lead unexpected
        errors. var is function-scoped while let and const are block-scoped. Var
        variables can be reassigned while let and const variables can not. const
        has the same block level scope similar to let. To conclude, its
        important and recommended to use let and const over var.

        Q2: Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
      </h1>
      <p>
        ->When there is a missing value or if we dont initialize the type then
        usually we get Undefined. If we intensionally keep an empty value then
        we can say this to be null. Example of a null can be a object with const
        friend={name:"sakib", salary:null}. Here we used null to indicate that
        the object property of salary empty state and has no value. For the same
        example if we want to find the age of friend object then it will give us
        undefined. Its better to use null.

      <h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold">Q3: What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
      <p>
        ->A REST API (Representation state Transfer API) is a programming
        interface that uses HTTP requests to access data using PUT, GET , POST
        and DELETE method. Basically My web page communicates with a cloud-based
        server via a rest API. They are all about communication means from
        client side to server or vice versa. The Equivalent of Create in an HTTP
        method is Post, Read is Get, Update is Put and Delete is Delete.
